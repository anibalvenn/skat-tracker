We do not:
- Share your data with third parties
- Use your data for marketing purposes

- Monetize your information in any way

## 4. Data Storage

- **Local Storage Mechanisms**: Skat Tracker uses your device's local storage and Capacitor Preferences to store game data directly on your device.

- **Data Control**: You have complete control over your data. You can view, edit, or delete your stored game information at any time through the app's interface.
- **No Backups**: We do not create backups of your data on external servers. You are responsible for backing up your own data if desired.

## 5. Third-Party Services

Skat Tracker operates independently with minimal dependencies:

- **No Analytics Services**: We do not use third-party analytics services to track your behavior.
- **No Advertisement Networks**: The app does not contain advertisements and does not share data with ad networks.

- **Access**: All your data is stored locally on your device and is accessible directly through the app's interface.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Skat Tracker is a card game score tracking app that:

- Is suitable for users of all ages
- Does not knowingly collect personal information from children
- Contains no content inappropriate for children
- Does not include features that would allow children to share personal information

While we do not specifically target children under 13, the app's functionality is appropriate for users of all ages. Since the app does not collect or transmit personal information, it complies with children's privacy protection regulations including COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act).

## 8. Security Measures

We prioritize the security of your data:

- **Local Storage Security**: All data is stored locally on your device and is as secure as your device's own security measures.
- **No Data Transmission**: Since we don't transmit your data to external servers, there is no risk of data interception during transmission.
- **App Permissions**: The app requires minimal permissions to function, further reducing potential security risks.

We recommend using standard device security measures (screen locks, up-to-date operating systems) to protect the data stored on your device.

## 9. Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time:

- **Policy Updates**: If we make significant changes to this policy, we will update the policy with a new effective date.
